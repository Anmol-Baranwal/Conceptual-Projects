# 🤝 Memory Game (4 Tiles) 🤝

This is a small game created with JQuery, a JavaScript framework that includes basic front-end programming.
<hr>

## 🧩 Rules to play the Game

- To begin, we must press a Key.

- Then any of the four tiles will blink, in which you have to click that tile.
- The game would have ended if you had clicked the wrong tile. You'd have to start the game anew by tapping a key.
- If you clicked the correct tile, the level would rise: now you must click the previous tile, followed by the current tile, to raise the level.

> ℹ️ Let's take an example

- Assume red blinks first, then blue blinks second:
   - The first tile in each sequence would be red; the second tile in each sequence would be blue.
   
- As the level rises, so will the sequence.
